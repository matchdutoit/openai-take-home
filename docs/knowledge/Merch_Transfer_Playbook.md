# Merch Transfer Playbook

## Transfer Triggers
- Prioritize SKUs with less than 7 days of cover in top-selling stores.
- Use regional balancing before markdowns when donor stores have overstock.

## Transfer Approval Guardrails
- Transfers require merch role and explicit confirmation.
- Transfers should include source, destination, quantity, and reason code.
- Re-check donor store safety stock before finalizing.

## Markdown Decision Notes
- Use markdowns only if transfer lead-time misses demand window.
- Keep markdown rationale linked to weekly sell-through trend.
