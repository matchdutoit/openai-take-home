# Conversation Starters

These starters map directly to scripted anomalies in `data/demo_manifest.json`.

## Associate (2)

1. "A customer at ST001 wants the Aster Linen Blazer in Sand, size M (`AST-LIN-BLZ-SND-M`). Check nearby availability within 25 miles and tell me which store I should offer first for a hold."
2. "Use policy docs to answer this: what is the standard hold duration and extension rule, and can you cite the exact section before I reserve `AST-LIN-BLZ-SND-M`?"

## Merch (2)

3. "Run a stockout-risk view for these five SKUs and recommend one immediate transfer to ST001: `ECL-RUN-SNK-WHT-08`, `NVA-UTL-TOT-CML-OS`, `LUN-WRP-DRS-COR-M`, `ORI-SLM-JEA-IND-30`, `HBR-LTH-SND-TAN-09`."
4. "I want to move 1 unit of `AST-LIN-BLZ-SND-M` from ST002 to ST001. Show me a transfer preview first, then wait for my confirm."

## Support (2)

5. "Summarize recurring issue clusters from current tickets, focusing on these categories: POS Sync Failure (18), Price Label Mismatch (16), BOPIS Pickup Delay (14), and Fitting Room QR Scanner (12)."
6. "Create a high-severity support ticket for ST001 for recurring POS Sync Failure, but show me a preview of the ticket details first and wait for confirm."
